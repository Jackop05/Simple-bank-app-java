# 🏦Bank Application 

## Overview

The Bank Application is a desktop application built in Java using **`Swing`** and **`Spring`**, designed to facilitate personal banking management. It allows users to register new accounts, securely log in, and manage their finances through a graphical user interface. Once logged in, users can check their account balance, deposit money into their account, and withdraw funds as needed. The application also includes a logout feature to ensure that users can exit securely. All user interactions are handled through a **`PostgreSQL`** database, which stores account details and transaction records. This tool aims to provide an intuitive and efficient way for users to manage their banking activities.
